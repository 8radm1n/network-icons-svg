# network-icons-svg
A collections of vendor neutral and vendor specific network device icons in SVG format.

These days I prefer to use vendor neutral icons as it saves alot of time updating diagrams 
as things change. SVG icons work fanastically with draw.io which is my go to diagram software.

Feel free to use them at your leisure.
